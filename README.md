# Shikigami
Personal conjured assistant template for fellow onmy≈çji :wind_chime:

## Setup:
Start by running `init.sh` after you create your own `config.yml` file.

shikigami is meant to be run in parallel as a series of ruby scripts under [pm2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).

This is currently the system I use to automate my life, sharing here in case anyone else finds it useful. Recommended to use with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [rvm](https://github.com/rvm/rvm).
